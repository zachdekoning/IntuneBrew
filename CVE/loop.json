      "description": "Sixteen XforWooCommerce Add-On Plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_svx_ajax_factory function in various versions listed below. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to read, edit, or delete WordPress settings, plugin settings, and to arbitrarily list all users on a WordPress website. The plugins impacted are: Product Filter for WooCommerce < 8.2.0, Improved Product Options for WooCommerce < 5.3.0, Improved Sale Badges for WooCommerce < 4.4.0, Share, Print and PDF Products for WooCommerce < 2.8.0, Product Loops for WooCommerce < 1.7.0, XforWooCommerce < 1.7.0, Package Quantity Discount < 1.2.0, Price Commander for WooCommerce < 1.3.0, Comment and Review Spam Control for WooCommerce < 1.5.0, Add Product Tabs for WooCommerce < 1.5.0, Autopilot SEO for WooCommerce < 1.6.0, Floating Cart < 1.3.0, Live Search for WooCommerce < 2.1.0, Bulk Add to Cart for WooCommerce < 1.3.0, Live Product Editor for WooCommerce < 4.7.0, and Warranties and Returns for WooCommerce < 5.3.0.",

      "description": "Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.",
