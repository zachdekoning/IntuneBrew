When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.",

      "description": "TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to stack buffer overflow, which could be triggered from CMsgReader::readSetCursor. This vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of PixelFormat. Since remote attacker can choose offset from start of the buffer to start writing his values, exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.",
